# Explore Instacart Data: Uncover Insights with K-Means

## Overview

This repository takes you on an exploration of grocery shopping patterns using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Our aim is to reveal patterns and insights that shed light on customer purchasing behavior.

## Dataset

The data we've utilized comes directly from Instacart, the pioneers in grocery delivery. Our dataset provides a comprehensive view of purchase transactions, product details, and valuable customer information that is relevant to this work.The data set can be found in this direction: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VBrZCXswH7Sd4ovUbidBMN7rCVOHCHSj/view?usp=sharing

**Data Sources:**
- Order Data
- Product Details
- Customer Information

## Getting Started

First, you have to install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Use

1. Download the Instacart datasets and store them in the `data/` directory.
2. Execute the main script, `exploratory_analysis`, to kick off the exploratory analysis:

```bash
python exploratory_analysis.py
```

3. Explore the outcomes and visualizations generated in the `reports/` folder.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Houses the Instacart datasets.
- `src/`: Python source code.
  - `notebooks/`: Shows the Jupyter notebooks of exploratory analysis.
- `reports/`: Find the results and visualizations here.

## Key Findings

Our exploratory analysis brings forth:

- Descriptive statistics offering insights into the data.
- Visualizations depicting the distribution of products and customers.
- Implementation of K-Means for customer segmentation.
- Visual representations of clusters formed by K-Means.
